# Panama Glass - Day 1 & 2
### Notes taken by University students



### Balboa Coin


Balboa Coin is an attractive project to foreign investors. Basically, it is a way to deliver the country a new UBI from the amount of money that the Panama Canal receives. They are many ways that were proposed at the Summit to decide what to do with this income, some of ideas proposed were making a fund for retirement, giving this money to citizens that are legal or have their ID’s, re-invest this money to make new infrastructure and improving the health care system here in Panama.



#### How will it work?

* Using the Panamanian ID to create a __digital identity__ with the Tribunal Electoral using cryptography for signature.

* The balboa coin could be seen as a way for locals to be stock-holders of Panama’s major asset.  Therefore, every Panamanian could get part of the income made by the Panama Canal during a year. In Norway, they use a concept where government money is given to the population as a social income, and it is called Sovereign fund. They have an oil fund where all the income resulted from the oil sales, is reinvested in greener or more sustainable ways to obtain energy making it the biggest fund in the world.

* To use the Balboa coins, it can be suggested several options like taking advantage of apps that already exists like Nequi or a blockchain wallet which will allow users to transfer money between them. It could also be implemented a king of hardware that will let users use Balboa coins to pay in restaurants and other locations. 

* A great way to implement this technology is installing a wallet in Panamanian phones direclty linked to an unique sim card  as a way to prevent fraud and having control of the UBI or dividend from the Canal. This way, most of the population in Panama could be reached  because not everybody has a bank account but everyone owns a smart phone. 

* The major bump on the road, is to get the population educated understanding the benefits of the Balboa coin. Therefore, the most important step is to develop trust within the community. We can take for example the US dollar, which use to be backed up by the Gold, however, as today, it is a reserve note which we trust it possesses the value it shows. So, the big question is, how can we get Panamanians to trust in this digital currency?

* It should be pegged to the US dollar or let it fluctuate in the market. Let's take Steem platform as an example where the steem coins value never drops less than a $1 US dollar creating security to the users. The Balboa Coin would be supported by the revenues of the Canal.

* The amount of Balboa coin to be produced using the Panama Canal revenue of $1.6 Billions USD will be distributed to the citizens of Panama. As UBI it would be $500 USD per year which is less than the minimum wage in country. 



#### How are the Panama Canal funds currently used?

* The Panama Canal income is given to the government which is used to cover up patches where money is missing. Unfortunately, the funds are mismanaged.  

* There is a plan to use the Canal funds to cover the Social Security debt.



#### How those funds could be used with the Balboa Coin?

* It could be used as an __Universal Basic Income (UBI)__ which is a concept to help people with low income. It is also called social income, just like being subsidize. It is a way to mitigate and provide people options to live. In the future, this could be a way for citizens to gain some kind of income since a lot of jobs won’t need a human being to serve since they will be performed by machines.

* Over 20% of the current jobs will be gone since they will be automatized. The question is, what machines can’t do in order for people to get educated and compete with them? It has been predicted to be the future in about 15 years from now.

* Another option could be to use them as retirement funds.  As today, Panama’s Social Security system is mixed and should be separated for an efficient way to work. There is a Ponzi scheme in the CSS were only one person pays for social security but the whole family gets medical attention for free. With the Balboa coin, it could be used as a way to take down the current Social Security system and actually be able to save money to be used for retirees. 



#### What type of benefits could the Balboa Coin provide to the country?

* It will be beneficial for the locals’ residents, the government and the shipping companies which could promote the exchange system between them.

* If we have investors buy Balboa coin, it could provide stability to the coin. 

* Balboa coin will be produced by year using the profits saved from the Canal income. At the end, the purpose of this proposal is for all Panamanian to be able to collect money from their shares in Canal

* It could be used as the 14th month, meaning, an additional income distributed to people on the day of their birthday, bringing an advantage to the country without causing traffic as it usually happens with the current 13th month. It would be a one time yearly payment.

* It will be used like any other online banking system, where BC could be exchanged into US Dollars to buy any service or products. Just like nowadays the balboa equivalents to a dollar. It will depend on how much the BC is valued at that time.



#### Inquiries:

* How could this bankrupt Panama? Is it possible? What happens if the Canal’s funds get reduced, how will this affect the Balboa coin?

* Comparing the value fluctuation with existing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, it raises a question: is the dollar falling or is it actually bitcoin rising? This is important to understand since all the currencies in the world are peg to the US dollar and their value fluctuates against it.

* Could this create a financial bubble or dumping? It could but to avoid dumping, for example, balboa coin dividends could be given to the beneficiary on their birthday and after they have turned 18 years old, that way it can be controlled the amount of money flowing out from the shares. The spending should be control, for example, in Norway they can only use 3% of the yearly share.

* Is Balboa Coin a subsidy or it is a way to empower Panamanian citizens to be stock holders of the Canal by giving them a voice to decide what the money from the Canal ($1.9 billions USD) should be used for?

* Would this project includ non-Panamanian citizens? Non-Panamanian residents could have the opportunity to purchase Balboa coins from people born in Panama empowering them to have a different way of thinking, in other words, an investor's midnset. The value of the currency could fluctuate depending on the market. 

* Could Balboa Coin replace the common dollar? Considering that this was true, we would need to create a small system of markets so that the Balboa Coins could be accepted in small shops. The most important part in this case is to build trust whithin the platform users breaking the current paradigms surrounding the electronic currency. 

* Will there be confusion between Panamanian Balboa and Balboa Coin?

* Can shipping companies save a lot of money using the Balboa coin and how would that affect the Panama Canal income?

* If it is beneficial for the ACP (Panama Canal Authority) because of the fees and time saved, what could make them say no?
